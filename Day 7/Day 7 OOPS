PYTHON - Structured + Object oriented

OOPS - object oriented programming language
Class
Object
Inheritance
Polymorphism

Class - *Logical entity *Doesnt require any memory *Blue print
Class is a collection of variables (attributes) and methods (behavior)
EX: Animal, Employee

Object - Physical entity EX: Dog, cat, Ravi, Anil.
Its instance of the class and it will occupy some space in the memory.

For one class we can create many methods.
Objects are independent.

FUNCTIONS AND METHODS

Functions can be craeted with out a class.
Methods has to be created within the class.

*** There are two type of methods we can define within the class.
1. Instance methods: We can call only through object.
2. Static methods: We can directly called within the class.

*** CLASS Variables - inside a class

**METHODS:
1. Give any value.
2. Return any value.
3. Method can take any arguments/parameters.
4. We have to invoke the method using an object.
 
**CONSTRUCTORS: __init__(self):
1. Constructor name is fixed in python.
2. It will not return any value.
3. It can take any arguments/paramters.
4. Constructor will be called the time of the object creation itself.
